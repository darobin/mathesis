        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I read a fair bit of things on a decent variety of topics. I take notes on all of that.
          And it's been going on for a while. But of course, I do nothing with these notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this document is to start articulating some of the more frequent topics to see
          if they might not amount to something overall. It is unlikely that they will, though some
          parts may reflect unreasonable ambition. What is to be found here is speculation on 
          intuitions, jotted down hastily. Reading this document is not particularly recommended.

          But hey, I'm having fun.

          - disembodied computation is just another mathematical tool, not immediately better
          - layered computers with properties that influence what runs on them though is an
